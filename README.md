# Simple EQ

### Spectrum Analyzer
The spectrum Analyzer shows the how you are carving the sound. It dynamically responds to any input from the user. There is no frequency display in the spectrum analyzer, but if you would like to add that, you can take the code from my [Multiband Compressor Repo!]()

### Controls
The two top large knobs control the frequency cutoff of the high and low pass. The middle knob controls the mid band of the EQ. The large bottom knobs control the slope of the EQ. The middle knobs controls the gain of the mid range, and the bottom knob controls the Q of the mid knob. The power buttons allow you to disable any of the bands.
